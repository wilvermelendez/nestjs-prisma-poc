# Nest Js Api with prisma

## Getting started

This project is a learning and practice exercise using Rest nest js API with Prisma and JWT for authentication and authorization.

This small project contains two basic modules, the first one is the authentication and authorization, and the second one is a simple user module where we can get information from the user through the JWT authorization token.

I would like to add credit
